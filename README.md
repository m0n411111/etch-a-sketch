1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
2. Create the divs using JavaScript… don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your html file!
    - Best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (that one can go directly in your html)
    - There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line) feel free to use any or play with each of them:
        float/clear
        inline-block
        flexbox
        CSS Grid
3. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
4.Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, resulting in possible delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
